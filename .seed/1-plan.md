I need you to plan an application to build. It's going to be like Excel - but in a browser. Have phases where the important features are done in the first phase and so on.

You decide the best tech stack and tools. It must include tests of functionality, but don't focus on it too much.

Split the plan up into files that go in todo/*.pending.md and note down the dependencies between the tasks so that you know what needs to come first.
